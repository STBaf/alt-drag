# alt-drag 2

A [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com) module to support disabling token
animations when a key is held down. By default this key is `Left Alt`,
but the keybinding can be configured using FoundryVTT's built-in
keybinding management.

This module is based on the original Foundry [alt-drag](https://git.sr.ht/~parasrah/alt-drag) module
from parashrah which is limited (atm) to v11 at the moment.

## Installation

At time of writing, you can install this module directly via the
manifest link:

## Thanks

Originating from the code of parashrah's original alt-drag ruler.

The following projects made understanding how to achieve this
functionality much easier, even if my implementation ended up
significantly different:
